# Applied Machine Learning: Algorithms

## Description

Understand how 5 of the most powerful machine learning algorithms are constructed, when they should be considered, what are some of the key hyper-parameters, and how to build a pipeline to test and evaluate all these algorithms, to determine the best model for a particular problem.

ML algorithms:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine
* Multi-Layer Perceptron
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting Tree

## Requirements

* Python 3.7
* Jupyter Notebook
* Anaconda3

## Create Virtual Environment

`conda create --name ml37 python=3.7`

`conda activate ml37`

`conda install -c conda-forge notebook`

`conda install -c anaconda joblib`

Use `jupyter notebook` to launch a notebook
